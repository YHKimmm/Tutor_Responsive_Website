            Engineering is a broad and exciting field that covers everything
            from building bridges to coding electronics, so it’s important that
            you figure out which type suits you best.

              The Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering (BEng
              Electrical) is a four year program that prepares students for a
              professional career as an Electrical Engineer. Graduates gain a
              strong practical foundation in engineering theory, analysis, and
              design, as well as the critical thinking skills needed to be
              successful as an engineer

            <p class="title">About the program</p>
            <p>
              The BEng Electrical program shares first year with the Diploma of
              Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology (ECET) to provide
              you with options for your engineering education. After successful
              completion of the first year, you can choose to continue in a
              technology diploma path or compete for a seat in the engineering
              degree program. The engineering degree path requires an additional
              three years of study. The BEng Electrical is recognized as a
              baccalaureate degree in British Columbia by the BC Ministry of
              Advanced Education and is nationally accredited by the Canadian
              Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). The program encompasses a
              wide range of subjects designed to advance both your technical
              knowledge and your skills in communications, management and
              professional practice. A four month workplace education experience
              allows you to apply your developing skills prior to graduation.
              (See program details page for more information). In a capstone
              project that spans the final year, you will apply your knowledge
              to a complex “real world” engineering design challenge, often an
              industry-sponsored project. For a comparison of the two degree
              programs offered by the Electrical and Computer Engineering
              department, please read our Frequently Asked Questions page.

            <p>
              This program is intended for those that are interested in finding
              solutions to complex problems across a range of industries and are
              looking to advance their technical knowledge.

            <p class="title">What grads can do</p>
            <p>
              Electrical engineers are employed by electrical utilities,
              communications companies, manufacturers of electrical and
              electronic equipment, computer manufacturers, government,
              consulting firms and a wide range of manufacturing, processing and
              transportation industries. They may work as employees, consultants
              or entrepreneurs. Graduates will be able to prepare design
              specifications, project reports, cost estimates and maintenance or
              operating standards. You will learn practical applications of
              electrical engineering with a strong theoretical foundation from
              instructors with many years of industry experience. Our
              well-equipped labs support your development of hands-on practical
              skills. The faculty in our program are motivated teachers. They
              are focused on providing applied education and helping you to
              succeed. You have ample opportunity to interact with our
              instructors in both lectures and labs. You will gain from BCIT’s
              strong reputation in industry. BCIT grads find relevant jobs
              quickly, and have a reputation of being productive from day one.
              The B.Eng Electrical degree is built to achieve similar success.
