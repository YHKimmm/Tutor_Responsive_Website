            <p>Your learning environment will be a blend of lectures, labs and tutorials. Our labs are well equipped to support your learning needs. For example, one recent industry donation helped us to build a state of the art process measurement and control lab. In almost every lab facility each student has their own individual work station.</p>

                <p class="content_title">Workplace education</p>
                <p>A Workplace Education work term is a part of the BEng Electrical program. This paid work experience would normally occur in the summer after either year two or year three. The experience gained in the work term gives students an added advantage in securing employment after graduation. The Centre for Workplace Education (CWE) maintains an online data base called CWE Bridge that allows students to view and apply to work terms. This platform is a tool to help BEng students satisfy the workplace education component of the program. BEng student access to the CWE Bridge is assessed in September and monitored on a continual basis. Most students in the BEng have access to the CWE Bridge except (i) students who have already completed the work placement requirement of the program and (ii) students who are in their final year of the program and who have a viable path to complete all of their courses by June of that year. These students will need to undertake an independent job search to meet their work term requirement for graduation.</p>
